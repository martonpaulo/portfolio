Welcome to my portfolio hosted at [martonpaulo.com](https://www.martonpaulo.com). This website showcases my projects, skills, and professional journey. Built with modern technologies and optimized for performance, it reflects my passion for front-end development.

## üåê Tech Stack

- **Front-End**: React with TypeScript and Next.js for static site generation, styled with Bulma CSS, icons provided by Phosphor Icons, dynamic data fetching with React Query
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages via domain provided by Hostinger at [martonpaulo.com](https://www.martonpaulo.com) with CI/CD pipeline on GitHub Actions
- **Back-End**: Directus headless CMS with a dockerized setup hosted on Railway at [directus.martonpaulo.com](https://directus.martonpaulo.com)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL hosted on AWS RDS
- **Media Management**: Cloudinary for storing and optimization
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics and Bitly for link tracking
- **Professional Email**: powered by Zoho Mail at [info@martonpaulo.com](mailto:info@martonpaulo.com) with custom domain

## üöÄ Setting Up the Environment

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/martonpaulo/portfolio.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd portfolio

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Available Scripts

- `npm run dev`: start the development server at `http://localhost:3000`
- `npm run build`: build the project for production
- `npm run lint`: lint the codebase with ESLint

### Disclaimers

#### CORS Issues

To avoid CORS issues when running the project locally, you may need to use a browser extension that enables CORS. This is required because the backend is hosted on a different domain.

#### Websocket Connection Error

During local development, you may encounter a WebSocket error in the console. This is related to the Hot Module Replacement (HMR) feature in Next.js. It is not an issue in production, as HMR is only used during local development and does not affect static site generation. You can safely ignore this warning.
